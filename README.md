<b><h2> Big data computing with R project </h2></b><br>
<p>    The  use  and  development  of  R  scripts  can  be  applied  to  analyze  various  aspects  of  Big  data processing. Preliminary data analysis can be divided into two approaches, namely: using the Dplyr vs. using Rodbc. Performance comparison can be carried out by profiling in terms of run time and working memory  space  of  Data  cleaning  and  other  steps.  Eventually,  Dplyr  package  is  selected  due  to  its performance. Upon completion with Dplyr, results can be visualized in various formats, making it easy to understand.</p><br> 
<p>    This  project  is  mainly  based  on  2019  Coronavirus  data  from  John  Hopkins  University.  The number of global infected, dead, recovered cases and several others are included. Top 20 most infected countries are chosen as our case studies. Gross domestic product, average temperature and public health system  rankings  are  incorporated  for  deeper  analyses.  The  results  can  be  visualized  in  line  graphs, heatmap, correlation and maps. </p><br>
